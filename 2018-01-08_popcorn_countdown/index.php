	<p>National Popcorn Day is observed annually January 19th.</p>
	<p>Popcorn started becoming popular in the United States in the middle 1800s. It wasnâ€™t until Charles Cretors, a candy-store owner, developed a machine for popping corn with steam that the tasty treat became more abundantly poppable. By 1900 he had horse-drawn popcorn wagons going through the streets of Chicago.</p>
	<p>Today, Americans consume 13 billion quarts of popcorn a year, more than any other country in the world. A majority of the popcorn produced in the world is grown in the United States. Nebraska leads the corn belt in popcorn production.
